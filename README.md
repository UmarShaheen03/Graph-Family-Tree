<p>&nbsp</p>  

## Getting Started
The App is developed using the Flask framework. To run the app locally, the repository will need to be pulled aswell as a python virtual environment will need to be set up.  
<p>&nbsp</p>  

### Creating a Python Env
To create a virtual environment run  

`python3 -m venv .venv`  
<p>&nbsp</p>

Then to activate the environment run  

`source .venv/bin/activate`  
<p>&nbsp</p>

### Installing python dependencies
To install the relevant dependencies and libraries a requirements.txt file has been provided. Whilst still in the Python Environment run  

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
<p>&nbsp</p>  

### Running Flask
Once all the relevant libraries are installed we can now run the app using  
`flask run`
